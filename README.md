# Simplified GAN for MNIST Dataset

This repository contains a simplified implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate handwritten digits (28x28 images) similar to those in the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the basic concepts of GANs, including the creation of a generator and discriminator, and their adversarial training process.

## Project Overview

- **Generator**: A neural network that takes random noise as input and generates fake MNIST-like images.
- **Discriminator**: A neural network that classifies images as real (from the MNIST dataset) or fake (generated by the Generator).
- **GAN**: The combined model that simultaneously trains the Generator and Discriminator in a competitive manner.

## Requirements

To run the code, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (for visualizing generated images)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
